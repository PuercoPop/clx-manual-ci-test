<dl compact="compact">
<dt>access control list</dt>
<dd><p>X maintains a list of hosts from which client programs can be run. By
default, only programs on the local host can use the display, plus any
hosts specified in an initial list read by the server. This <em>access
control list</em> can be changed by clients on the local host. Some
server implementations can also implement other authorization
mechanisms in addition to or in place of this mechanism. The action of
this mechanism can be conditional based on the authorization protocol
name and data received by the server at connection setup.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>action</dt>
<dd><p>A function that is designed to handle an input event. CLUE input
processing consists of matching an event with an event specification
found in a contact&rsquo;s <var>event-translations</var> slot and then calling
actions associated with the matching event specification.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>active grab</dt>
<dd><p>A grab is <em>active</em> when the pointer or keyboard is actually owned
by the single grabbing client.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>ancestors</dt>
<dd><p>If W is an inferior of A, then A is an <em>ancestor</em> of W.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>atom</dt>
<dd><p>A unique ID corresponding to a string name. Atoms are used to identify
properties, types, and selections.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>backing store</dt>
<dd><p>When a server maintains the contents of a window, the off-screen saved
pixels are known as a <em>backing store</em>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>before action</dt>
<dd><p>An action of a <var>contact-display</var> that is called when an event is
dispatched to a contact, but before any other contact input processing
is performed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>bit gravity</dt>
<dd><p>When a window is resized, the contents of the window are not
necessarily discarded. It is possible to request the server to
relocate the previous contents to some region of the window. This
attraction of window contents for some location of a window is known
as <em>bit</em> <em>gravity</em>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>bitmap</dt>
<dd><p>A pixmap of depth one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>button grabbing</dt>
<dd><p>Buttons on the pointer can be passively <em>grabbed</em> by a
client. When the button is pressed, the pointer is then actively
grabbed by the client.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>byte order</dt>
<dd><p>For image (pixmap/bitmap) data, byte order is defined by the server,
and clients with different native byte ordering must swap bytes as
necessary. For all other parts of the protocol, the byte order is
defined by the client, and the server swaps bytes as necessary.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>callback</dt>
<dd><p>A function that represents a connection between a contact and the rest
of an application program. A contact calls a callback function in
order to report the results of the user interface component that it
represents.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>children</dt>
<dd><p>First-level subwindows of a window.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>class event</dt>
<dd><p>Event translations that belong to all instances of a contact class. A
class event <var>translations</var> translation is created by the
<var>defevent</var> macro.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>class resources</dt>
<dd><p>Resources defined for each instance of a contact class. Also see
constraint resources.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>click</dt>
<dd><p>A <var>:button-press</var> event followed immediately by a
<var>:button-release</var> event for the same button, with no intervening
change in pointer position or modifier key state.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>client</dt>
<dd><p>An application program connects to the window system server by some
interprocess communication (IPC) path, such as a TCP connection or a
shared memory buffer. This program is referred to as a <em>client</em>
of the window system server. More precisely, the client is the IPC
path itself. A program with multiple paths open to the server is
viewed as multiple clients by the protocol. Resource lifetimes are
controlled by connection lifetimes, not by program lifetimes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>clipping regions</dt>
<dd><p>In a graphics context, a bitmap or list of rectangles can be specified
to restrict output to a particular region of the window. The image
defined by the bitmap or rectangles is called a <em>clipping
region</em>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>colormap</dt>
<dd><p>A set of entries defining color values. The colormap associated with a
window is used to display the contents of the window. Each pixel value
indexes the colormap to produce RGB values that drive the guns of a
monitor. Depending on hardware limitations, one or more colormaps can
be installed at one time, such that windows associated with those maps
display with correct colors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>composite</dt>
<dd><p>A subclass of <var>contact</var> representing contacts that are the
parents of other contacts. A composite provides geometry management
and input focus management services for the contacts that are its
children.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>complete resource class</dt>
<dd><p>A list of symbols containing the class of the contact, the class of
the contact&rsquo;s <var>parent</var> (and so on), and the class of the
<var>contact-display</var> to which the contact belongs.  The complete
resource class is one of the two items used as a key by a CLUE
application in order to access a contact resource value in a resource
database.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>complete resource name</dt>
<dd><p>A list of symbols containing the <var>name</var> of the contact, the
<var>name</var> of the contact&rsquo;s <var>parent</var> (and so on), and the name
of the <var>contact-display</var> to which the contact belongs. The
complete resource name is one of the two items used as a key by a CLUE
application in order to access a contact resource value in a resource
database.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>connection</dt>
<dd><p>The IPC path between the server and client program. A client program
typically has one connection to the server over which requests and
events are sent.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>constraint resources</dt>
<dd><p>Resources defined for each child belonging to a member of a composite
class.  Constraint resources are typically used to control the
parent&rsquo;s geometry management policy.  Also see class resources.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>contact</dt>
<dd><p>The basic CLUE object for programming a user interface.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>contact-display</dt>
<dd><p>The CLUE object type that represents a connection to an X server and
that supports an event loop for application input.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>contact initialization</dt>
<dd><p>The process of collecting initial values for all contact
attributes. No server resources (windows and so on) are actually
allocated until contact realization.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>contact realization</dt>
<dd><p>The process of allocating contact resources. This process completes
contact creation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>containment</dt>
<dd><p>A window contains the pointer if the window is viewable and the hot
spot of the cursor is within a visible region of the window or a
visible region of one of its inferiors. The border of the window is
included as part of the window for containment. The pointer is in a
window if the window contains the pointer but no inferior contains the
pointer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>content</dt>
<dd><p>The single child of a shell. The basic geometry management policy
implemented by the <var>shell</var> class constrains a shell and its
content to have the same width and height; size changes to one are
automatically applied to the other.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>coordinate system</dt>
<dd><p>The coordinate system has x horizontal and y vertical, with the origin
[0, 0] at the upper left. Coordinates are discrete and are in terms of
pixels. Each window and pixmap has its own coordinate system. For a
window, the origin is at the inside upper left, inside the border.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>cursor</dt>
<dd><p>The visible shape of the pointer on a screen. It consists of a
hot-spot, a source bitmap, a shape bitmap, and a pair of colors. The
cursor defined for a window controls the visible appearance when the
pointer is in that window.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>depth</dt>
<dd><p>The depth of a window or pixmap is number of bits per pixel it
has. The depth of a graphics context is the depth of the drawables it
can be used in conjunction with for graphics output.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>descendant</dt>
<dd><p>If W is an inferior of A, then W is a <em>descendant</em> of A.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>device</dt>
<dd><p>Keyboards, mice, tablets, track-balls, button boxes, and so forth, are
all collectively known as input <em>devices</em>. The core protocol only
deals with two devices: the keyboard and the pointer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>direct color</dt>
<dd><p>A class of colormap in which a pixel value is decomposed into three
separate subfields for indexing. One subfield indexes an array to
produce red intensity values, the second subfield indexes a second
array to produce blue intensity values, and the third subfield indexes
a third array to produce green intensity values. The RGB values can be
changed dynamically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>dispatching an event</dt>
<dd><p>The process of finding the appropriate contact and its actions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>double-click</dt>
<dd><p>A sequence of two clicks of the same button in rapid succession.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>drawable</dt>
<dd><p>Both windows and pixmaps can be used as sources and destinations in
graphics operations. These are collectively known as
<em>drawables</em>. However, an <var>:input-only</var> window cannot be used
as a source or destination in a graphics operation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>event</dt>
<dd><p>Clients receive information asynchronously via <em>events</em>. These
events can be either asynchronously generated from devices, or
generated as side effects of client requests.  Events are grouped into
types; events are never sent to a client by the server unless the
client has specifically asked to be informed of that type of event,
but clients can force events to be sent to other clients. Events are
typically reported relative to a window.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>event compression</dt>
<dd><p>Ignoring (or compressing) certain redundant input events. Compression
of redundant events is controlled by the class slots
<var>compress-exposures</var> and <var>compress-motion</var>, which are shared
by all instances of a contact class.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>event loop</dt>
<dd><p>The fundamental application control structure: wait for an event,
figure out how to handle it, process the event, then go back and wait
for the next one. In CLUE, the event loop is implemented using the
<var>process-next-event</var> function.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>event mask</dt>
<dd><p>Events are requested relative to a window. The set of event types a
client requests relative to a window are described using an <em>event
mask</em>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>event propagation</dt>
<dd><p>Device-related events <em>propagate</em> from the source window to
ancestor windows until some client has expressed interest in handling
that type of event, or until the event is discarded explicitly.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>event specification</dt>
<dd><p>A notation for describing a certain sort of event. CLUE input
processing consists of matching an event with an event specification
found in a contact&rsquo;s <var>event-translations</var> slot and then calling
actions associated with the matching event specification.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>event synchronization</dt>
<dd><p>Certain race conditions are possible when demultiplexing device events
to clients (in particular deciding where pointer and keyboard events
should be sent when in the middle of window management
operations). The event synchronization mechanism allows synchronous
processing of device events.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>event source</dt>
<dd><p>The smallest window containing the pointer is the <em>source</em> of a
device related event.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>event translation</dt>
<dd><p>The process of determining which contact action functions will be
executed. An event translation is a list found in a contact&rsquo;s
<var>event-translations</var> slot associating an event specification with
one or more action names. Also see class event translations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>exposure event</dt>
<dd><p>Servers do not guarantee to preserve the contents of windows when
windows are obscured or reconfigured. <em>Exposure</em> events are sent
to clients to inform them when contents of regions of windows have
been lost.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>extension</dt>
<dd><p>Named <em>extensions</em> to the core protocol can be defined to extend
the system. Extension to output requests, resources, and event types
are all possible, and expected.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>focus window</dt>
<dd><p>Another term for the input focus.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>font</dt>
<dd><p>A matrix of glyphs (typically characters). The protocol does no
translation or interpretation of character sets. The client simply
indicates values used to index the glyph array. A font contains
additional metric information to determine inter-glyph and inter-line
spacing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>geometry management</dt>
<dd><p>The process whereby a composite controls the geometrical properties of
its child contacts; the composite is referred to as the geometry
manager.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>glyph</dt>
<dd><p>An image, typically of a character, in a font.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>grab</dt>
<dd><p>Keyboard keys, the keyboard, pointer buttons, the pointer, and the
server can be <em>grabbed</em> for exclusive use by a client. In
general, these facilities are not intended to be used by normal
applications but are intended for various input and window managers to
implement various styles of user interfaces.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>gcontext</dt>
<dd><p>Shorthand for graphics context.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>graphics context</dt>
<dd><p>Various information for graphics output is stored in a <em>graphics
context</em> (or gcontext), such as foreground pixel, background pixel,
line width, clipping region, and so forth. A graphics context can only
be used with drawables that have the same root and the same depth as
the graphics context.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>gray scale</dt>
<dd><p>A degenerate case of pseudo color, in which the red, green, and blue
values in any given colormap entry are equal, thus producing shades of
gray. The gray values can be changed dynamically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>hot spot</dt>
<dd><p>A cursor has an associated <em>hot spot</em> that defines a point in the
cursor that corresponds to the coordinates reported for the pointer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>identifier</dt>
<dd><p>Each resource has an <em>identifier</em>, a unique value associated with
it that clients use to name the resource. An identifier can be used
over any connection to name the resource.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>inferiors</dt>
<dd><p>All of the subwindows nested below a window: the children, the
children&rsquo;s children, and so on.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>initialization</dt>
<dd><p>See contact initialization.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>input event</dt>
<dd><p>See event.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>input focus</dt>
<dd><p>Normally a window defining the scope for processing of keyboard
input. If a generated keyboard event would normally be reported to
this window or one of its inferiors, the event is reported normally;
otherwise, the event is reported with respect to the focus window. The
input focus also can be set such that all keyboard events are
discarded and that the focus window is dynamically taken to be the
root window of whatever screen the pointer is on at each keyboard
event.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>input-only window</dt>
<dd><p>A window that cannot be used for graphics requests. <em>input-only</em>
windows are invisible, and can be used to control such things as
cursors, input event generation, and grabbing.  <em>input-only</em>
windows cannot have <em>input/output</em> windows as inferiors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>input/output window</dt>
<dd><p>The normal kind of opaque window, used for both input and
output. Input/output windows can have both <em>input/output</em> and
input-only windows as inferiors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>insensitivity</dt>
<dd><p>See sensitivity.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>interactive-stream</dt>
<dd><p>A contact subclass designed to integrate CLUE with the conventional
stream-based I/O of Common Lisp.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>key grabbing</dt>
<dd><p>Keys on the keyboard can be passively <em>grabbed</em> by a client. When
the key is pressed, the keyboard is then actively grabbed by the
client.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>keyboard grabbing</dt>
<dd><p>A client can actively <em>grab</em> control of the keyboard, and key
events will be sent to that client rather than the client to which the
events would normally have been sent.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>keysym</dt>
<dd><p>An encoding of a symbol on a keycap on a keyboard.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>managed</dt>
<dd><p>A contact under geometry management control.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>mapped</dt>
<dd><p>A window is said to be <em>mapped</em> if a map call has been performed
on it. Unmapped windows and their inferiors are never viewable or
visible.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>modifier keys</dt>
<dd><p>SHIFT, CONTROL, META, SUPER, HYPER, ALT, Compose, Apple, CAPS LOCK,
Shift Lock, and similar keys are called <em>modifier keys</em>.

<dd><p>A special case of static gray, in which there are only two colormap
entries.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>obscure</dt>
<dd><p>A window is <em>obscured</em> if some other window obscures it. For
example, window A obscures window B if:
</p><ul>
<li> Both windows are viewable <var>:input-output</var> windows

</li><li> Window A is higher in the global stacking order than window B

</li><li> The rectangle defined by the outside edges of window A intersects the rectangle
defined by the outside edges of window B
</li></ul>

<p>Notice that window borders are included in the calculation, and that a window can be
obscured and yet still have visible regions. See occlude (there is a fine distinction
between obscure and occlude).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>occlude</dt>
<dd><p>A window is <em>occluded</em> if some other window occludes it. For
example, window A occludes window B if:
</p><ul>
<li> Both windows are mapped

</li><li> Window A is higher in the global stacking order than window B

</li><li> The rectangle defined by the outside edges of window A intersects the rectangle
defined by the outside edges of window B
</li></ul>

<p>Notice that window borders are included in the calculation. See
obscure (there is a fine distinction between occlude and obscure).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>override-shell</dt>
<dd><p>A subclass of <var>shell</var> used to override the window manager. This
subclass contains pop-up menus and other temporary objects that the
user can never resize and so on.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>padding</dt>
<dd><p>Some padding bytes are inserted in the data stream to maintain
alignment of the protocol requests on natural boundaries. This
increases ease of portability to some machine architectures.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>parent window</dt>
<dd><p>If C is a child of P, then P is the <em>parent</em> of C.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>passive grab</dt>
<dd><p>Grabbing a key or button is a <em>passive grab</em>. The grab activates
when the key or button is actually pressed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>pixel value</dt>
<dd><p>An <em>n</em>-bit value, where <em>n</em> is the number of bit planes used
in (that is, the depth of) a particular window or pixmap. For a
window, a pixel value indexes a colormap to derive an actual color to
be displayed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>pixmap</dt>
<dd><p>A three dimensional array of bits. A pixmap is normally thought of as
a two dimensional array of pixels, where each pixel can be a value
from 0 to (2<em>n</em>)-1, where <em>n</em> is the depth (z axis) of
the pixmap. A pixmap can also be thought of as a stack of <em>n</em>
bitmaps.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>plane</dt>
<dd><p>When a pixmap or window is thought of as a stack of bitmaps, each
bitmap is called a <em>plane</em> or <em>bit plane</em>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>plane mask</dt>
<dd><p>Graphics operations can be restricted to only affect a subset of bit
planes of a destination.  A <em>plane mask</em> is a bit mask describing
which planes are to be modified, and it is stored in a graphics
context.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>pointer</dt>
<dd><p>The pointing device attached to the cursor and tracked on the screens.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>pointer grabbing</dt>
<dd><p>A client can actively <em>grab</em> control of the pointer, and button
and motion events will be sent to that client rather than the client
to which the events would normally have been sent.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>pointing device</dt>
<dd><p>Typically a mouse or tablet, or some other device with effective
dimensional motion.  There is only one visible cursor defined by the
core protocol, and it tracks whatever pointing device is attached as
the pointer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>pop-up</dt>
<dd><p>One of the uses of a top-level shell (for example, a menu that pops up
when a command button contact is activated). Setting the <var>state</var>
of a shell to <var>:mapped</var> is sometimes referred to as
<em>mapping</em> or <em>popping up</em> the shell. Setting the
<var>state</var> of a shell to <var>:withdrawn</var> or <var>:iconic</var> is
sometimes referred to as <em>unmapping</em> or <em>popping down</em> the
shell.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>property</dt>
<dd><p>Windows can have associated <em>properties</em>, consisting of a name, a
type, a data format, and some data. The protocol places no
interpretation on properties; they are intended as a general-purpose
naming mechanism for clients. For example, clients might share
information such as resize hints, program names, and icon formats with
a window manager via properties.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>property list</dt>
<dd><p>The list of properties that have been defined for a window.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>pseudo color</dt>
<dd><p>A class of colormap in which a pixel value indexes the colormap to
produce independent red, green, and blue values. That is, the colormap
is viewed as an array of triples (RGB values). The RGB values can be
changed dynamically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>realization</dt>
<dd><p>See contact realization.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>redirecting control</dt>
<dd><p>Window managers (or client programs) may choose to enforce window
layout policy in various ways. When a client attempts to change the
size or position of a window, the operation can be <em>redirected</em>
to a specified client, rather than the operation actually being
performed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>reply</dt>
<dd><p>Information requested by a client program is sent back to the client
with a <em>reply</em>. Both events and replies are multiplexed on the
same connection. Most requests do not generate replies. However, some
requests generate multiple replies.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>representation type</dt>
<dd><p>The type of representation of a resource value. For example, a color
value might be represented either as a namestring (&quot;red&quot;), a pixel
value, an RGB triplet, an HSV triplet, and so on.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>request</dt>
<dd><p>A command to the server is called a <em>request</em>. It is a single
block of data sent over a connection.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>resource</dt>
<dd><p>A value of the user interface that can be changed by the user in a
resource database via CLX functions <var>add-resource</var>,
<var>get-resource</var>, and so forth. See server resource.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>resource class, complete</dt>
<dd><p>See complete resource class.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>resource database</dt>
<dd><p>Conceptually, a set of resource name/value pairs (or resource
bindings). CLX defines functions for storing and retrieving interface
resources from a resource database.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>resource name, complete</dt>
<dd><p>See complete resource name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>RGB values</dt>
<dd><p><em>Red</em>, <em>green</em>, and <em>blue</em> intensity values used to
define color. These values are always represented as 16-bit unsigned
numbers, with zero being the minimum intensity and 65535 being the
maximum intensity. The values are scaled by the server to match the
display hardware.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>root</dt>
<dd><p>A special composite contact used to represent an entire display
screen.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>root window</dt>
<dd><p>Each screen has a <em>root window</em> covering it. It cannot be
reconfigured or unmapped, but otherwise acts as a full-fledged
window. A root window has no parent.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>save set</dt>
<dd><p>The <em>save set</em> of a client is a list of other client&rsquo;s windows
that, if they are inferiors of one of the client&rsquo;s windows at
connection close, should not be destroyed and that should be remapped
if it is unmapped. Save sets are typically used by window managers to
avoid lost windows if the manager should terminate abnormally.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>scanline</dt>
<dd><p>A list of pixel or bit values viewed as a horizontal row (all values
having the same y coordinate) of an image, with the values ordered by
increasing x coordinate.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>scanline order</dt>
<dd><p>An image represented in <em>scanline order</em> contains scanlines
ordered by increasing y coordinate.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>screen</dt>
<dd><p>A server can provide several independent <em>screens</em>, which
typically have physically independent monitors. This would be the
expected configuration when there is only a single keyboard and
pointer shared among the screens.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>selection</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <em>selection</em> can be thought of as an indirect property with
dynamic type. That is, rather than having the property stored in the
server, it is maintained by some client (the <em>owner</em>).  A
selection is global in nature, being thought of as belonging to the
user (but maintained by clients), rather than being private to a
particular window subhierarchy or a particular set of clients. When
a client asks for the contents of a selection, it specifies a
selection <em>target type</em>. This target type can be used to
control the transmitted representation of the contents.
</p>
<p>For example, if the selection is &quot;the last thing the user clicked
on&quot; and that is currently an image, then the target type might
specify whether the contents of the image should be sent in XY
Format or Z Format. The target type can also be used to control the
class of contents transmitted; that is, asking for the looks (fonts,
line spacing, indentation, and so forth) of a paragraph selection,
rather than the text of the paragraph. The target type can also be
used for other purposes; the semantics is not constrained by the
protocol.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>sensitivity</dt>
<dd><p>A condition in which a user interface component of an application will
accept input.  Conversely, when a contact is insensitive, events of
particular types are not dispatched to the contact and are ignored.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>server</dt>
<dd><p>The <em>server</em> provides the basic windowing mechanism. It handles
IPC connections from clients, demultiplexes graphics requests onto the
screens, and multiplexes input back to the appropriate clients.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>server grabbing</dt>
<dd><p>The server can be <em>grabbed</em> by a single client for exclusive
use. This prevents processing of any requests from other client
connections until the grab is complete. This is typically only a
transient state for such things as rubber-banding and pop-up menus, or
to execute requests indivisibly.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>server resource</dt>
<dd><p>Windows, pixmaps, cursors, fonts, gcontexts, and colormaps are known
as resources.  They all have unique identifiers associated with them
for naming purposes. The lifetime of a resource is bounded by the
lifetime of the connection over which the resource was created. See
resource.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>shell</dt>
<dd><p>A composite that handles the duties required by standard conventions
for top-level X windows.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>sibling</dt>
<dd><p>Children of the same parent window are known as <em>sibling</em>
windows.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>static color</dt>
<dd><p>A degenerate case of pseudo color in which the RGB values are
predefined and read-only.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>static gray</dt>
<dd><p>A degenerate case of gray scale in which the gray values are
predefined and read-only.  The values are typically (near-)linear
increasing ramps.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>stacking order</dt>
<dd><p>Sibling windows can <em>stack</em> on top of each other. Windows above
both obscure and occlude lower windows. This is similar to paper on a
desk. The relationship between sibling windows is known as the
<em>stacking order</em>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>state</dt>
<dd><p>A slot of <var>contact</var> that controls the visual effect of the
contact.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>stipple</dt>
<dd><p>A bitmap that is used to tile a region to serve as an additional clip
mask for a fill operation with the foreground color.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>tile</dt>
<dd><p>A pixmap can be replicated in two dimensions to <em>tile</em> a
region. The pixmap itself is also known as a tile.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>timer</dt>
<dd><p>A CLUE object that provides support for animation and other types of
time-sensitive user interfaces. A timer causes <var>:timer</var> events to
be dispatched to a specific contact for processing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>timestamp</dt>
<dd><p>A time value, expressed in milliseconds, typically since the last
server reset. Timestamp values wrap around (after about 49.7
days). The server, given its current time is represented by timestamp
T, always interprets timestamps from clients by treating half of the
timestamp space as being earlier in time than T and half of the
timestamp space as being later in time than T. One timestamp value
(named CurrentTime) is never generated by the server; this value is
reserved for use in requests to represent the current server time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>top-level contact</dt>
<dd><p>A contact whose parent is a root. A top-level contact is usually a
composite at the top of a hierarchy of other contacts created by an
application program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>top-level-session</dt>
<dd><p>A subclass of <var>shell</var> that is used to communicate with a session
manager.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>top-level-shell</dt>
<dd><p>A subclass of <var>shell</var> that provides full window manager
interaction.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>transient-shell</dt>
<dd><p>A subclass of <var>shell</var> that a window manager typically will unmap
when its owner becomes unmapped or iconified and will not allow to be
individually iconified.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>true color</dt>
<dd><p>A degenerate case of direct color in which the subfields in the pixel
value directly encode the corresponding RGB values. That is, the
colormap has predefined read-only RGB values. The values are typically
(near-)linear increasing ramps.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>type</dt>
<dd><p>An arbitrary atom used to identify the interpretation of property
data. Types are completely uninterpreted by the server; they are
solely for the benefit of clients.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>unmanaged</dt>
<dd><p>A contact that is not under geometry management control.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>user interface</dt>
<dd><p>A set of abstract interface objects used to control the dialog between
an application and its human user.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>viewable</dt>
<dd><p>A window is <em>viewable</em> if it and all of its ancestors are
mapped. This does not imply that any portion of the window is actually
visible. Graphics requests can be performed on a window when it is not
viewable, but output will not be retained unless the server is
maintaining backing store.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>visible</dt>
<dd><p>A region of a window is <em>visible</em> if someone looking at the screen
can actually see it; that is, the window is viewable and the region is
not occluded by any other window.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>window gravity</dt>
<dd><p>When windows are resized, subwindows can be repositioned automatically
relative to some position in the window. This attraction of a subwindow
to some part of its parent is known as <em>window gravity</em>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>window manager</dt>
<dd><p>Manipulation of windows on the screen, and much of the user interface
(policy) is typically provided by a <em>window manager</em> client.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>window manager shell</dt>
<dd><p>A subclass of <var>shell</var> called <var>wm-shell</var> that interacts with
the window manager.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>XY Format</dt>
<dd><p>The data for a pixmap is said to be in <em>XY Format</em> if it is
organized as a set of bitmaps representing individual bit planes, with
the planes appearing from most to least significant in bit order.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Z Format</dt>
<dd><p>The data for a pixmap is said to be in <em>Z Format</em> if it is
organized as a set of pixel values in scanline order.
